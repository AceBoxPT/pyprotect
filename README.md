# pyprotect
This is a simple online tool to obfuscate python codes and "hide" their sources. It was inspired by former _pyobfuscate.tk_ project, rest in piece.

### Important information
Please note that **this is not an advanced encryption tool** and it's intended only to prevent your code from being read by those who don't know programming very well. _It is quite possible to decrypt the codes using basic methods, so do not use this tool to hide important information._

### Example
